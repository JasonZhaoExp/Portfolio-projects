# My journey

This README outlines a diverse set of projects and skills to learn in Python, C++, web development, and hands-on cybersecurity over the next two years. These projects are categorized into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.

## **Projects I wanna do**

Over the next two years, before I graduate, I want to complete these projects.

### [Easy projects](src/easy/PROJECTS.md)
Projects that I could easily do now (January 2025) without much help

### [Intermediate projects](src/intermediate/PROJECTS.md)
Projects that I want to do by the end of 2025

### [Harder projects](src/hard/PROJECTS.md)
Projects that I want to be able to do without too many problems by the end of 2026

### **The final test**
- Combine domains for larger projects:
  - [ ] Conduct a full **Penetration Test** on a custom-built web application.
  - [ ] Build a **Machine Learning-Powered Security Tool** using Python.
  - [ ] Simulate a **Secure Network Architecture** with virtualized environments.

## **How I will carry them out**
For each project, they will be in their own folder, categorised by difficulty, then by the langauge, then the project name. 

For example, the email project would be in the src/easy/python/email folder.

I will ask ChatGPT to help me mark the projects after completion, asking if it has met the requirements and for any possible improvements
