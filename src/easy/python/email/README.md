# Automated Email Sender

## **Overview**
The Automated Email Sender is a Python application designed to simplify the process of sending emails with attachments. Utilizing Python's built-in `smtplib` library, this tool allows users to automate email sending, making it ideal for notifications, reminders, or any situation where bulk emailing is required.

## **Functionalities**
- **Automate Sending Emails**: Send emails automatically without manual intervention.
- **Attachments**: Include files as attachments in the emails.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors during the email sending process.

## **Features**
- **Scheduling Emails**: Schedule emails to be sent at a specific time or interval.
- **Template-Based Content**: Use templates for email content to maintain consistency and professionalism.
- **Secure Handling of Credentials**: Store and manage email credentials securely to prevent unauthorized access.

## **Usage Instructions**
1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install any required libraries (if applicable) using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Configuration**:
   - Update the configuration file or script with your email provider's SMTP server details, your email address, and password.
   - For Gmail, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" or use an App Password if you have 2-Step Verification enabled.

3. **Sending an Email**:
   - Run the script with the necessary parameters:
     ```bash
     python send_email.py --to recipient@example.com --subject "Subject Here" --body "Email body here" --attachment "path/to/file"
     ```

4. **Scheduling**:
   - To schedule an email, you can use a task scheduler like `cron` on Unix-based systems or Task Scheduler on Windows.

## **Tests**
- **Email Format Validation**: Ensure that the email addresses conform to standard formats (e.g., user@example.com).
- **Provider Compatibility**: Test sending emails with different email providers (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) to ensure compatibility.
- **Error Handling**: Simulate failed email attempts (e.g., incorrect credentials, network issues) and verify that informative error messages are displayed.
