# Web Scraper

## **Overview**
The Web Scraper is a Python application designed to extract and process data from websites. This tool allows users to gather information from various web pages and store it in a structured format, such as CSV or a database. It is particularly useful for data analysis, research, and automation tasks.

## **Functionalities**
- **Extract Data from Websites**: Retrieve specific data points from web pages based on user-defined criteria.
- **Process and Clean Data**: Format and clean the extracted data for further analysis or storage.
- **Store Data**: Save the processed data in a CSV file or a database for easy access and manipulation.

## **Features**
- **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling for invalid URLs and connection issues.
- **Support for Multiple Pages**: Scrape data from multiple pages or websites in a single run.
- **Customizable Data Extraction Rules**: Allow users to define specific rules for data extraction, such as selecting HTML elements or attributes.

## **Usage Instructions**
1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install any required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
     ```

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Execute the script to start the web scraping process:
     ```bash
     python web_scraper.py --url "http://example.com" --output "data.csv"
     ```
   - Replace `"http://example.com"` with the target URL and `"data.csv"` with your desired output file name.

3. **Customizing Extraction Rules**:
   - Modify the extraction rules in the script to specify which data points to scrape from the target website.

## **Tests**
- **Website Structure Testing**: Test the scraper with different website structures to ensure compatibility.
- **Data Accuracy**: Validate the accuracy of the extracted data against the source website.
- **Rate Limiting and CAPTCHA Handling**: Implement tests to handle rate-limiting and CAPTCHA mechanisms gracefully.z
