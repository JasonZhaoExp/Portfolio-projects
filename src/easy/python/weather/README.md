# Weather App

## **Overview**
The Weather App is a Python application that fetches and displays live weather data using an external API, such as OpenWeatherMap. This application allows users to get real-time weather updates for any location, making it a useful tool for planning daily activities or trips.

## **Functionalities**
- **Fetch Live Weather Data**: Retrieve current weather information based on user-provided location.
- **Display Weather Information**: Present weather data in a user-friendly format, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors related to API requests and invalid locations.

## **Features**
- **Location-Based Weather Fetching**: Allow users to input a city name or geographical coordinates to get weather data.
- **Historical Weather Data**: Provide access to past weather data for the specified location.
- **Customizable Themes**: Enable users to switch between light and dark modes for better visibility.

## **Usage Instructions**
1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install any required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

2. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
   - Update the configuration file or script with your API key.

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Execute the script to start the application:
     ```bash
     python weather_app.py
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter a location and receive the current weather data.

4. **Customizing Themes**:
   - Modify the theme settings in the configuration file to switch between light and dark modes.

## **Tests**
- **API Connectivity**: Test the connection to the OpenWeatherMap API to ensure data retrieval is successful.
- **Error Handling**: Simulate invalid locations and verify that appropriate error messages are displayed.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure the response time of the API calls and ensure the application handles slow connections gracefully.
